We wanted to experience how people in Turkey feel about Ekrem İmamoglu and Re-Election process of IBB and started our work by calling libraries.

```{r cars}
options(stringsAsFactors=FALSE)
library(httpuv)
library(plyr)
library(tidyverse)
library(lubridate)
library(rtweet)
library(tidytext)
library(wordcloud)
library(tm)


```

My twitter developer account is not activated yet so I cannot have access to everything i want but I searched for the most popular # for elections which is #HerseyCokGuzelOlacak . I can't make a sentiment analysis in Turkish language yet so I chose the language as English to bring English tweets in that hashtag


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
tweets_raw <- search_tweets("#HerseyCokGuzelOlacak", n = 5000, include_rts = FALSE, lang = "en",retryonratelimit = TRUE)

glimpse(tweets_raw)



```

That gave me the 5000 tweets from Twitter's random tweet pool for the hashtag. Then I wanted to see who used the hashtag most
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

tweets_raw %>% count(screen_name,sort=TRUE) %>% slice(1:10) %>% knitr::kable()


```
as it is seen in the table some people used the hashtag more than one tweet. Then I tried to make an analysis about words used most in those tweets 



```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
tweet_words <-
  tweets_raw %>% 
  select(text) %>%
  unnest_tokens(word,text,token = "tweets") %>% 
  filter(!word %in% stop_words$word,
         !word %in% str_remove_all(stop_words$word, "'"),
         str_detect(word, "[a-z]")) 
tweet_words %>% count(word,sort=TRUE) %>% slice(1:20) %>% knitr::kable()


```



I saw that people using that hashtag mentioned about Ekrem İmamoglu most to adumbrate their support to him. 

then I made a wordcloud of the most used words 

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
wordcloud(tweet_words$word,max.words = 100)
sentiments %>% filter(lexicon=="bing") %>% slice(1:10) %>% knitr::kable()

```

then I made a sentiment analysis to the words used in tweets and try to understand how people feel about situation and found that sad feelings are majority

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
entiment_words <-
  tweet_words %>% 
  left_join(.,
            sentiments %>% filter(lexicon=="bing") %>% select(word,sentiment), 
            by="word"
  ) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(sentiment)) 

sentiment_words %>% slice(1:10) %>% knitr::kable()


```
